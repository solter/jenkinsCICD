# System Requirements
While the installation is expected to work for a broad set of debian-based distros, they were developed on and have been verified for the following system.
* Ubuntu Desktop 20.04.1 LTS (available at https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
  * this was developed against an VM install using the "Minimal installation" option from the installer
  * in principle, it should work for any Ubuntu 20.04.01 installation (but has only been verified against a newly installed system)
* sudo access to the installed system
