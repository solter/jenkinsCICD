# Application directory
This directory hosts the code for the application managed by the project.

The application itself started via using [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io),
using maven, java 11, and Sprint Boot 2.4.3.

It is merely a simple web app that displays hello world and can add two numbers
passed in as URL parameters.
